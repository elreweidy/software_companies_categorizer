We bring Transporeon forward every day with our knowledge, skills, commitment and finally every one of us with your very own transformation.",

Because the transportation industry in many areas lags behind what happens in our digital, transparent, data-driven and increasingly sustainable world. Around 30% idle capacity, millions of empty runs on our streets, long waiting times at ports, docks and airports and broken information and communication flows are the consequence. A problem that is big but that can be solved and one that we are deeply in love with. We use technology, or more precisely, connectivity, data and real-time insight to solve the problem. Every day we support our amazing clients with excellent customer service and a highly functional, innovative and reliable cloud-platform. This result is only possible with an amazing team of more than 1,400 people. We bring Transporeon forward every day with our knowledge, skills, commitment and finally every one of us with your very own transformation. With your passion, your desire to discover new things and help us solve the complex challenges we are curiously dealing with every day, you can transform too – the world around you and yourself. Regardless of whether you are just starting your career or already a pro - You are the transformation.",

            "At Transporeon, our mission is to bring transportation in sync with the world. Because the transportation industry in many areas lags behind what happens in our digital, transparent, data-driven and increasingly sustainable world. Around 30% idle capacity, millions of empty runs on our streets, long waiting times at ports, docks and airports and broken information and communication flows are the consequence. A problem that is big but that can be solved and one that we are deeply in love with. We use technology, or more precisely, connectivity, data and real-time insight to solve the problem. Every day we support our amazing clients with excellent customer service and a highly functional, innovative and reliable cloud-platform. This result is only possible with an amazing team of more than 1,400 people. We bring Transporeon forward every day with our knowledge, skills, commitment and finally every one of us with your very own transformation. With your passion, your desire to discover new things and help us solve the complex challenges we are curiously dealing with every day, you can transform too – the world around you and yourself. Regardless of whether you are just starting your career or already a pro - You are the transformation.",

However, they do not receive information that personally identifies users. If you do not want to participate in the tracking process, you can also refuse the required setting of a cookie – for example, via a browser setting that generally disables the automatic setting of cookies.

Conversion Tracking 5.2.1. Google Ads conversion tracking To statistically record the use of our website and to evaluate it for the purpose of optimising our website, we also use Google Conversion Tracking. In doing so, Google Ads will set a cookie (see 4 (Cookies)) on your computer if you have reached our website via a Google ad. These cookies lose their validity after 30 days and are not used for personal identification. If you visit certain pages of the Ads customer’s website and the cookie has not expired, Google and the customer may recognise that you have clicked on the ad and have been redirected to this website.Your information will currently be automatically deleted at the latest after 18 months.Every Ads customer receives a different cookie. Cookies cannot be tracked via the websites of Ads customers. The information gathered using the conversion cookie is used to generate conversion statistics for Ads customers who have opted for conversion tracking. Ads customers are given the total number of users who clicked on their ad and who were redirected to a page with a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not receive information that personally identifies users. If you do not want to participate in the tracking process, you can also refuse the required setting of a cookie – for example, via a browser setting that generally disables the automatic setting of cookies. You can also disable cookies for conversion tracking by setting your browser to block cookies from the domain “www.googleadservices.com”.
