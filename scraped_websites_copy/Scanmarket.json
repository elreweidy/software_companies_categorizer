Organizations increasingly rely on software vendors to be true partners  to help improve their operations. The Emotional Footprint helps you understand how you can trust and  rely on the vendor to support you through your relationship.  We collect 25 data points outlining that experience, from the initial contracting and negotiation phase,  though how they will support you during conflicts, to how their overall product strategy and direction  will help you improve. Use this report to understand which vendors focus on building relationships to  create a loyal customer base.What Do We Measure?  The Emotional Diamond helps identify which vendors provide the best overall experience when compared  against the perceived value of the software.  Value Index: Software pricing can be complicated and confusing, but knowing if you’re getting business  value for the price you're paying is not. The Value Index metric captures users’ satisfaction with their  software given the costs.  Net Emotional Footprint: The Net Emotional Footprint measures high-level user sentiment. It aggregates  emotional response ratings across 25 provocative questions, creating a powerful indicator of overall  user feeling toward the vendor and product.",
